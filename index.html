  <h2>Hey, It's me Ben and I own NotifiedGaming. I have a story to tell you.</h2>
  <p>I used my own YouTube account that wasn't a channel.</p>
  <p>I found out that I could upload from my phone and so I did for a few videos.</p>
  <p>I got very few subscribers and a friend said "Hey you should make a new channel! a proper channel that is!" and so we did and that brings us to "BotGaming".</p>
  <p>I've had since 2005 and we both decided we need to make a new channel But new something no one else has used before and so here is NotifiedGaming!</p>
